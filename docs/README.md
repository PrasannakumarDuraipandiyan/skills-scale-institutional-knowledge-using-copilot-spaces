# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

## Project Management Processes Overview

OctoAcme uses an iterative, customer‑centric project management approach:

- Project initiation: gate ideas with a Project One-pager and stakeholder alignment.
- Planning: break work into shippable increments, define acceptance criteria, and map milestones.
- Execution & tracking: use a project board workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), small PRs, CI gating, daily standups, and regular demos.
- Risk & communication: maintain a Risk Register, escalate per the defined paths, and use weekly status updates for stakeholders.
- Release & deployment: follow pre-release checks, smoke tests, rollback plan, and an incident playbook.
- Retrospectives & improvement: run timeboxed retros, track action items, and feed improvements back into the backlog.
